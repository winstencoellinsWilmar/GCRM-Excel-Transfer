# GCRM-Excel-Transfer
This repository is created in order to simplify the file transfer from VAS Global CRM to become an excel documentation `GCRM_VAS_CODE_List.xlsx` with partial automation. You will still need to modify some of the excel file.

## Dependencies
Dependencies needed:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (Optional)
- Pandas
- Numpy

Install Python: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

<br />

After installing Python, you can install the dependencies above with the command below:
```python
pip install pandas numpy
```

## How to generate excel file?

After cloning this repository, you will need create two folders in the same directory where the `main.py` file is:
1. `updated`
2. `excel`

<br />

`Updated` folder will be where the excel files generated by the python progarm goes, while `excel` folder will be the folder where we place our exported excel file from the Global CRM.

<br />

`Excel` folder must have the following files:
1. `vas.xlsx` -> Excel file exported from the Value and Scope in GCRM. (rename the exported excel file from VAS Global CRM to `vas.xlsx`)
2. `dev_vas_code.xlsx` -> Excel workbook created from the DEV_VAS_CODE worksheet from the `GCRM_VAS_CODE_List.xlsx`. All you need to do is to copy the DEV_VAS_CODE worksheet and paste it in the `dev_vas_code.xlsx` file.

<br />

```
Note: make sure that the "Business Item" column is named "Business Item" (with space) as it will affect the flow of the program.
```

<br />

Finally, you will need to run the command below:
```bash
python main.py
```
